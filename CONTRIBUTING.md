# Contributing to Tea
## Helpful Contributions
Tea is still a pre-alpha project (right now, it doesn't even work). That said,
if you'd like to jump in and contribute, we are currently working on:

### Documentation
We are still trying to flesh out the documentation. This includes both source
docs and also the project documentation (including this file!).

One thing that would be especially helpful would be either suggestions or an
implementation of automatically creating the rustdocs for the source code.

### Website
TODO

### Implementation
Currently, most efforts are being focused on implementing the core functionality
of both the UI and the backend. If you are looking for something specific to
jump in on, feel free to [contact us and talk it up](TODO).

## Setting up your development environment
### Rust
For right now, Tea is built using the latest Rust nightly. To get started with
Rust, it is recommended to use [Rustup](https://rustup.sh) and install the
nightly build.

#### Rustfmt
Rustfmt is used to automatically format the code in this repository. Please make
sure that any pull requests have been formatted with this repository's settings.
Non-formatted PRs will be rejected.
